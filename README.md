The Pomodoro app is a simple time management tool based on the Pomodoro Technique. The app allows you to set a timer for 30 minutes of work and then a 5 minute break. After four work sessions, the app gives you a longer break of 30 minutes. The app is designed to be minimalistic and easy to use. You can start, pause, and reset the timer with just a few clicks. The app also provides basic statistics on your productivity throughout the day.
